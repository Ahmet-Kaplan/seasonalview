0.1.5   2016-??-??
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the hood:

- better way to pass stuff to shiny app, using shinyOptions()
- workaround functions to properly import xts, which depends on zoo functions, 
  so that seasonalview can be imported from other packages, such as seasonal. 
  This will be reworked once a new version of xts is on CRAN.
